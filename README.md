# The openweathermap-api cli app
A simple Python command line application that consumes the openweathermap API using a HTTP client library.

# Running the commandline app
First clone it to your local machine using
`git clone https://github.com/borenho/openweathermap-api`

Then simply navigate to the project directory and run `python app.py`

Cheers!
